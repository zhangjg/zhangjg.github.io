## Chapter 5: Standard Reduction##
The definition of the **ISWIN** evaluator via an equatinal proof system is elegant and flexible. A programmer can liberally apply the rules of the equational system in any order and at any place in the program, pursuing any strategy for such a calculation that seems profitable, then switching as soon as a different one appears to yield beeter result.We know form the Church-Rosser Theorem that a program is *equal* to a value precisely when it reduces to a value, we already know that we can rely on reductions in search for a result.But even the restriction to reductions is not completely satisfactory beacuase there are still so many redexes to choose from. An implementation would clearly benefit from knowing that picking a certain reduction step out of the set of possible steps guaranteed progress; otherwise it would have to search too many different reduction paths.

Given a program, it is possible to pick a redex according to a fixed strategy such that the reduction of the redex brings the evaluation one step closer to the result. The strategy is know as Curry-Feys Standardization. The strategy and its correctness theorem, the Curry-Feys Standard Reduction Theorem, are the subject of the first section.

The standard reduction strategy essentially defines a **textual machine** for **ISWIN**.
## 5.1 Standard Reductions##
A good evaluation strategy base on reductions should only **pick redexes that are outside of abstractions**.We make this more precise with a set of two rules:

1. If the expression is an application and all components are values, then, if the expression ia a redex, it is the next redex to be reduced; if not, the program *cannot* have a value.
2. If the expresion is an application but does not only consist of values, then pick one of the non-values and search for a potential redex in it.
3. If the program is an application such that at least one of its sub-expression is not a value, pick the leftmost non-value and search for a redex in there.

By following the above algorithm, we divide a program into an application consisting of values and a context. The shap of such a context is determined by our rules: it is eather a hole, or it is an application and the sub-context is to the right of all values.The formal definition for the set of **evaluation contexts** E:
<center>![5.1.1](/ref/2015-09-10/5.1.1.png "5.1.1" )</center>
** Theorem 5.1 [Unique Evalution Contexts]:** For all *M*, eather *M = V*, or there exists a unique evaluation context *E* such that *M = E[(V<sub>1</sub> V<sub>2</sub>)]* or *M = E[(o<sup>n</sup> V<sub>1</sub> ... V<sub>n</sub>)]*

Theorem 5.1 verify that our informal strategy picks a unique sub-expression from a program as a potential redex. 
To get an answer for a program: if it a value, there is noting to do, otherwise decompose the program into an evaluation context and a redex, reduce the redex, and start over. To formalize this idea, we introduce a **standard reduction relation** ![standard reduction relation ](../ref/2015-09-10/stand_reduction_relation.png "standard reduction relation"):
<center> ![5.1.2](/ref/2015-09-10/5.1.2.png "5.1.2" )</center>

We pronounce M ![standard reduction relation ](../ref/2015-09-10/stand_reduction_relation.png "standard reduction relation") N as "*M standard-reduces to N*". ![standard reduction relation transitive-reflexive closure](../ref/2015-09-10/stand_reduction_relation_trc.png "standard reduction relation transitive-reflexive closure") is transitive-reflexive closure of ![standard reduction relation ](../ref/2015-09-10/stand_reduction_relation.png "standard reduction relation").
