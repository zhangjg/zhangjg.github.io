In this chapter, we introduct Landin's **ISWIN**.&lambda;-calculus is call-by-name,whereas **ISWIN** is call-by-value.
In &lambda;-calculus,(&lambda;x. 1)(**sub1** &lambda;y.y) reduces to (the encoding of) 1. But in the call-by-value languages, (**sub1** &lambda;y.y) can't eval to a value,so the (&lambda;x. 1)(**sub1** &lambda;y.y) can not to be reduce.

The basic syntax of **ISWIN** is the same as for the &lambda;-calculus, and the notions of free variables and substition are the same. Unlike the &lambda;-calculus and more like real programming languags, **ISWIM** comes with a set of basic constants and primitive operations. But the more fundamental difference is in **ISWIN**'s call-by-value reducion rules.
## 4.1 ISWIN Expressions##
The grammar for **ISWIM** extends the &lambda;-calculus grammar:
<center> ![4.1.1](/ref/2015-09-07/4.1.1.png "4.1.1")</center>
where an expression (o<sup>n</sup> M<sub>1</sub> ... M<sub>m</sub>) is valid only if n = m. The following is defintions b and o<sup>n</sup>:
<center> ![4.1.2](/ref/2015-09-07/4.1.2.png "4.1.2")</center>
The syntactic object <sup>┌</sup>1<sup>┐</sup> repressents the integer 1. The syntactic object + represents an addtion operator,&uarr; is exponentiation, etc. In addtions, we define a helpfull **if0** macro:
<center> ![4.1.3](/ref/2015-09-07/4.1.3.png "4.1.3")</center>
The FV and \_[\_ &larr;\_] relations extend to the new grammar in the obvious way:

## 4.2 ISWIN Reductions##
The **value** of set definion :
<center>![4.2.1](/ref/2015-09-07/4.2.1.png "4.2.1")</center>
So, A value is a constant, a variable or an abstraction (ie. a function). The core reduction relation for **ISWIM** is &beta;<sub>v</sub>,which is like &beta;,except that the argument must be in V instead of M:
<center>((&lambda;X. M) &beta;<sub>v</sub> M[X &larr; V] </center>
In addtion to function application, the **ISWIM** reduction rules need to account for primitive operations. In the same way that *b* and *o<sup>n</sup>* are abstract in principle, the reductions associated with the primitive operations are represented by an abstract &delta;. The &delta; relation maps each *o<sup>n</sup>* plus n basic constants to a value.
<center>![4.2.2](/ref/2015-09-07/4.2.2.png "4.2.2")</center>
By combining &beta; and &deta;, we arrive at the complete reduction relation **v**.
<center> **v** = &beta;<sub>v</sub> &cup; &delta;</center>
As usual, &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub>  is the compatible closure of **v**,↠<sub>**v**</sub>  is the reflexive-transitive closure of &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub>, and =<sub>**v**</sub> is the symmetric closure of ↠<sub>**v**</sub>
## 4.3 The Y<sub>v</sub> Combinator##
**Y** in &lambda;-calculus can be used to define recursive functions.But in **ISWIN**, it donot work.
<center>![4.3.1](/ref/2015-09-07/4.3.1.png "4.3.1")</center>
The **Y<sub>v</sub>** combinator :
<center>![4.3.2](/ref/2015-09-07/4.3.2.png "4.3.2")</center>
The **Yv** combinator works when applied to a function that takes a function and returns another one.
**Theorem 4.1 [Fixed-Point Theorm for Yv]**: if K=&lambda;gx.L,then (K (Yv K)) =<sub>v</sub> (Yv K).
**Proof for Theorm 4.1**:
<center>![4.3.3](/ref/2015-09-07/4.3.3.png "4.3.3")</center>

To avoid compliction, we show that an argument that is provably equal to a value(but is not necessarily a value yet) can already be used as if it were a value for the purposes of =<sub>**v**</sub>.
**Theorem 4.2**: if M =<sub>**v**</sub>,then for all (&lambda;X.N),((&lambda;X.N) M) =<sub>**v**</sub> N[X &larr; M].

**Proof Theorem 4.2**:The inital portion of the proof is a simple calculation:    
((&lambda;X.N M) =<sub>**v**</sub> ((&lambda;X.N) V) =<sub>**v**</sub> N[X &larr;V]=<sub>**v**</sub> N[X &larr; M]
We should proof the last step in this calculation,show that N[x&larr;M]=<sub>**v**</sub> N[X&larr;L] if M=<sub>**v**</sub> L:

+ Base case:
    - Case N = b
    b[X&larr; M] = b =<sub>**v**</sub> b = b[&larr;L].
    - Case N= Y
    if Y = X, then X[X &larr; M] = M =<sub>**v**</sub> L = X[X &larr; L]。 Otherewise， Y[X&larr;M]=Y=<sub>**v**</sub> Y=Y[X&larr;L].
+ Inductive case:
    - Case N =(&lambda;Y.N&prime;)
    if Y = X, then N[M &larr; X] = N =<sub>**v**</sub> N = N[L &larr; X]. Otherwise, by induction, N&prime;[X &larr; M] =<sub>**v**</sub> N&prime;[X &larr; L].Then，
    <center>(&lambda;Y.N&prime;)[X &larr; M]<br>
     = (&lambda;Y.N&prime;[X &larr; M])<br>
     =<sub>**v**</sub> (&lambda;Y.N&prime;[X &larr; L])
     = (&lambda;Y.N&prime;)[X &larr; L]
    </center>
    - Case N=(N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub>)
    By induction,N<sub>i</sub>[X &larr; M] =<sub>**v**</sub> N<sub>i</sub>[X &larr; L] for i &in;[1,2]. Then,
    <center>(N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub>)[X &larr; M] <br>
    =(N<sub>1</sub>[X &larr; M] N<sub>2</sub>[X &larr; M])<br>
    =<sub>**v**</sub> (N<sub>1</sub>[X &larr; L] N<sub>2</sub>[X &larr; L])<br>
    =(N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub>)[X &larr; L]</center>
    - Case N=(o<sup>n</sup> N<sub>1</sub> ... N<sub>n</sub>)
    Analogous to the previous case.
 
## 4.4 Evalution##
We define *A* to be the set of results for evaluating **ISWIM** functions:
<center>*A = b &cup; {function}*</center>

The partial function eval<sub>v</sub> is defined as follows:
<center>![4.4.1](/ref/2015-09-07/4.4.1.png "4.4.1")</center>
If eval<sub>v</sub>(M) does not exist, we say that M **diverges**. For example.&Omega; diverges.
## 4.5 Consistency##

**Theorem 4.3 [Consistency of *eval*<sub>v</sub>]**:The relation *eval*<sub>v</sub> is a partial function.
**Proof for Theorem 4.3**: Assume that the Church-Rosser Property holds: if *M =<sub>v</sub> N* then exists a expression *L* such that *M ↠ L* and *N↠L*.
Let *eval*<sub>**v**</sub>(M) = A<sub>1</sub> and *eval*<sub>**v**</sub>(M) = A<sub>2</sub> for answers A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. We need to show than A<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub>. Base on the definition of **ISWIN** answers, we distinguish two cases:

+ Case A<sub>1</sub> &in; b,A<sub>2</sub> &in; b    
It follows from Church-Rosser that two basic constants are provably equal if and only if they are identical, since neither is reducible.
+ Case A<sub>1</sub> = function, A<sub>2</sub> &in;b    
By the definition of *eval*<sub>**v**</sub>,*M =<sub>**v**</sub> A<sub>2</sub>* and *M =<sub>**v**</sub> &lambda;x.N*. Again by Church-Rosser and the irreducibility of constants,*&lambda;x.N↠<sub>**v**</sub> A<sub>2</sub>*. But by definition of the reduction relation ↠<sub>**v**</sub>,*&lambda;x.N↠<sub>**v**</sub>K* implies that *K=&lambda;x.K&prime;*.Thus it is impossible that *&lambda;x.N* reduces to *A<sub>2</sub>*,which mean that the assumptions of the case are contradictory.
+ Case A<sub>1</sub> &in; b, A<sub>2</sub> = **function**    
Analogous to the previous case.
+ Case A<sub>1</sub> = **function**,A<sub>2</sub> =**function**    
Then A<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub>

**Theorem 4.4 [Church-Rosser for ISWIN]**: If *M =<sub>**v**</sub> N*,then there exist an expression *L* such that *M ↠<sub>**v**</sub> L* and *N ↠<sub>**v**</sub> L*.

**Proof for Theorem 4.4**: The proof is essentially a replica of the proof for =<sub>**r**</sub>(Theorem 2.2). It assumes a diamond property for the reduction relation ↠<sub>**v**</sub>

**Theorem 4.5 [Diamond Property for ↠<sub>v</sub>**: If *L ↠<sub>**v**</sub> M*,*L ↠<sub>**v**</sub> N*,then there exists an expression *K* such that *M ↠<sub>**v**</sub> K* and *N ↠<sub>**v**</sub> K*.

The diamond property *cannot* hold for &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub>. The &beta;<sub>v</sub> reduction can copy redexes in the argument of a function, which prevents the existenc of the common contractum in certain diamonds.
For an example, consider the expression
<center>![4.5.1](/ref/2015-09-07/4.5.1.png "4.5.1")</center>
which contains the two overlapping and underlined &beta;<sub>v</sub>-redexes. By one or the other of one of them,we get the expressions 
<center> <u>((&lambda;x.(x x)) (&lambda;y. (&lambda;x.x)))</u></center>
and <center>((&lambda;y.<u>((&lambda;x,x)(&lambda;x.x))</u>) (&lambda;y.<u>((&lambda;x.x))</u>))</center>.
Both expressions contains redexes, but as the following diagram shows, the one-step reductions starting from these expressions do not lead to a common expression.
<center>![4.5.2](/ref/2015-09-07/4.5.2.png "4.5.2")</center>
Hence, the one-step relation &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub> does not satisfy the diamond property.

Since the problem to the one-step relation base on **v** is caused by reductions that duplicate redexes, we consider an extension &prime;&rightarrow;<sub>**v**</sub> of the one-step reduction &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub> that contracts several non-overlapping redexes in parallel. If this extension satisfies the diamond property, and if its transitive-reflexive closure is the same as that of &rarr;<sub>**v**</sub>,then we can prove the diamond property for the ↠<sub>**v**</sub> reduction.

The parallel extension &prime;&rarr;<sub>**v**</sub> is defined as follows:
<center>![4.5.3](/ref/2015-09-07/4.5.3.png "4.5.3")</center>
## 4.7 History##
In a series of papers in the mid-1960's,Landin expounded two important observations about programming language. First, he argued that all programming languages share a basic set of facilities for specifying computation but differ in there choice of data and data primitives. The set of common facilties contains names, procedures, applications, exception mechanisms, mutable data structures, and possibly other forms of ono-local control.

Second, he urged that programmers and implementors alike should think of a progamming language as an advanced, symbolic form of arithmetic and algebra. Since all of us are used to calculating with numbers, booleans, and even more complex data structures from our days in kindergarten and high school, it should be easy to calculate with programs, too. Program evaluation, many forms of program editing, program transformations, and optimizations are just different, more elaborate forms of calculation. Instead of simple arithmetic expressions, such calculations with programs and pieces of programs.

Landin defined the programming language **ISWIN**.
